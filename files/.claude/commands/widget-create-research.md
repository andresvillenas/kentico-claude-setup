# Document Heading

You are tasked with the process of creating a new prompt for generating a new widget.

## Input Parameters

- **User Input Folder Path:** `$userInputFolderPath` - The path to the folder that contains user input files with requirements and design for the new widget. You must follow these when creating the final prompt.

## Steps to follow

- First, check all documentation links in the `.claude/instructions/docs.md` file using Kentico Docs MCP.

- Next, read all remaining files in the `.claude/instructions/` folder.

- Then, check all requirements and design files in the user-input folder, whose path the user has provided to you.

- Check the current state of the project for resources you will need for creation of the widget. If you find already present widgets, follow their patterns and conventions.

- Finally, create a new instructions file in the user-input folder that will allow you to generate a new widget. Use `.claude/create-instructions/CREATION_TEMPLATE.md` as a base and fill in all the parts in brackets. Other parts of the file must stay the same as in the template.
